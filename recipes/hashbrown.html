    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon of clarified butter</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. Stir until water is cloudy; drain and cover potatoes again with fresh cold water. Stir again to dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry with paper towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture.</li>
            <li>Heat clarified butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded potatoes into hot butter in an even layer; season with cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip or stir and continue to cook until potatoes are browned and crusty all over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
